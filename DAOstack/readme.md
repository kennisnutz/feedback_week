## blockchain feedback week #0: DAOstack
in order to buy us all some time, and extend the concept of "feedback week" into
practical and scalable futures, after this "feedback package" has been assembled
and deployed onto https://github.com/tippi-fifestarr/feedback_week.git, everyone
can "sign off" on how vague they want their "avatar" to be.  

## avatars
IPFS links to "content", variable levels of detail (think of https://brilliant.org/practice/making-decisions-4/) 
to enhance vagueness and preserve psudoanonymity.
OR, no detail linked to each "document", rather summarize the "participants", and
then structure the results by type.

## documents
folder and document structure.
.jpg for necessary images.

## participants
over the course of the week, the following types manifested tangible (documentable)
contributions to the feedback week:

0. tippi fifestarr, webdev wingbird, often uses metamask
1. recently retired american dad (1998 MCSE), has metamask
2. mid thirties tri-lingual chinese man, no metamask
3. 29 year old tri-lingual hong konger, has metamask
4. mid thirties american man bi-lingual, no metamask
5. mid thirties web 2.03 developer american, has metamask 
6. 79 year old provincial midwestern capitalist, no metamask 

the necessity to use this for our whole information system, the ultimate statement
